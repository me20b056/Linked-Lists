Enhanced Linked-List Class in Python: Enriching User Accessibility with Extended Functionality

In this project, I took the existing Linked-List class in Python and elevated its capabilities to provide users with a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience. By incorporating a range of new functions, I aimed to streamline common operations and empower users to efficiently manage their data structures.

Key Enhancements:

Append and Prepend Functions: I implemented functions that allow users to effortlessly add elements to the end or beginning of the linked list. This simplifies the process of expanding or modifying the list while maintaining optimal performance.
Print Function: To facilitate easier data visualization, I integrated a print function that displays the linked list's contents in a clear and readable format. This feature proves especially valuable when dealing with larger data sets.
Insert Function: Recognizing the importance of flexibility, I introduced an insert function. This function empowers users to seamlessly add elements at specific positions within the linked list, accommodating diverse data management needs.
Node Swapping: I further extended the class by incorporating a node swapping function. Users can now efficiently swap the positions of two nodes within the linked list, enhancing their ability to reorganize and manipulate data.
By refining the Linked-List class and introducing these user-centric functions, I aimed to foster a more intuitive and efficient approach to data manipulation. This project showcases my commitment to enhancing existing solutions and providing users with tools that align with their practical needs.
